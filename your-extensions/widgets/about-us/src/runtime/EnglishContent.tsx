      and the implementation of the digital information hub for Climate Change
      adaptation, the development of a geospatial data visualization tool has
      been required.
    </p>

    <p>
      This web-based spatial tool presents the results of Climate Change
      projection models in a simple and easily understandable way, by utilizing
      maps and charts, aiming to boost the understanding of Climate Change
      impacts and their analysis, as well as to support the design of adaptation
      policies and measures.
    </p>

    <p>
      This climate data have been calculated for two periods in the future:{" "}
      <b>2031–2060</b> (near future) and <b>2071–2100</b> (distant future). The
      Reference Period (current situation) spans the years <b>1971–2000</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      These future climate projections are based on three Greenhouse Gases
      Emissions scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways – RCPs),
      developed by IPCC:
    </p>

    <ul className="about-list">
      <li>
        The Very Stringent scenario of mitigation (<b>RCP 2.6</b>),
      </li>
      <li>
        The Intermediate scenario (<b>RCP 4.5</b>), and The Extreme one, with
        very high GHG emissions (<b>RCP 8.5</b>).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In case of no additional mitigation measures, the scenario <b>RCP 8.5</b>{" "}
      will occur, while under <b>RCP 2.6</b>, the temperature increase is
      expected to remain below 2&nbsp;°C in comparison to the pre-industrial
      levels.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>More Specifically:</b>
    </p>
    <ul className="about-list">
      <li>
        Scenario <b>RCP 2.6</b> assumes that the maximum global GHG emissions
        occurred during the previous decade (2010–2020), and a significant
        decrease will follow.
      </li>
      <li>
        According to scenario <b>RCP 4.5</b>, GHG emissions will increase until
        about 2040, and they will decrease thereafter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, according to scenario <b>RCP 8.5</b>, the global GHG emissions
        will continue to increase throughout the 21st century.
      </li>
    </ul>

      The National Observatory of Athens, in collaboration with the Academy of

      Store (CDS) of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) with a
      horizontal resolution of approximately <b>0.11°</b>. The spatial
      resolution of the maps that were produced based on these estimations is{" "}
      <b>500&nbsp;m</b> and was achieved by applying spatial interpolation
      methods to the raw model data. The results of the models are presented by
      the tool both as absolute values and as differences from the current

      Furthermore, the changes per 5-year periods of the indicators “mean
      precipitation” and “mean temperature” for all prefecture capitals were
      calculated. These time series are presented both for the current period
      (blue line) and for future periods (up to 2100), using the GHG emissions
